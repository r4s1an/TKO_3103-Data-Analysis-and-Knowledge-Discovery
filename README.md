Student Projects in TKO_3103-Data-Analysis-and-Knowledge-Discovery

Content

The course introduced methods and algorithms for extracting information and knowledge from data sets. This included techniques for data pre-processing, visualizing high-dimensional data, basic machine learning methods for supervised learning (classification, regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, association rule analysis), model selection and validating how well a learned model predicts on new data (holdout, cross-validation). The CRISP-DM process model is introduced as a tool for analysing and implementing data science projects.
